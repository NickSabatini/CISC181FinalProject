	/*  Final Coding portion of the final for CISC181.  Professor: Bert Gibbons
	 * 
	 *  Project Notes:
	 *  
	 *  I couldn't figure out the full project, but as of now if you go to Payment.java and scroll to the
	 *  bottom you can enter any values into the constructor for Loan in the main function and when you run
	 *  the program, all of the payments will be created and put onto the console.  I figured this would at
	 *  least get me some points for my logic in creating payment an loan.
	 *  
	 *  I understand that the project was turned in late but I had a small extension granted to me by prof
	 *  Gibbons.  I wanted to turn in something that worked rather than a pile of crap.
	 *  
	 *  Thanks and happy grading!
	 *
